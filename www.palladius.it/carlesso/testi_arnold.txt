Lyrics to the theme song: (arnold, different strokes)

Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum 
What might be right for you, may not be right for some 
A man is born, he's a man of means 
Then along come two, they got nothin' but their jeans 
But they got Diff'rent Strokes 
It takes Diff'rent Strokes 
It takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world 

Everybody's got a special kinda story 
Everybody finds a way to shine 
It don't matter that you got not a lot- so what? 
They'll have theirs, you'll have yours and I'll have mine 
And together we'll be fine, 
Cause it takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world, yes it does 
It takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world!
